# Project_echolalia_detection
 
Final project: I designed a system for echolalia detection in autism spectrum disorder. To develop the echolalia detection system, I leveraged Python for code implementation. Libraries like NumPy and SciPy provided the foundation for data manipulation and signal processing tasks. Using speech spectrograms, I explored classical methods (dynamic time warping algorithm) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs, utilizing a Siamese neural network). For machine learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. This allowed me to compare the effectiveness of different approaches in identifying echolalia from speech features.
